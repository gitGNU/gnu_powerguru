  Currently I'd ignore the src directory. This is the support code for the
barely started Glade2 GUI. I postponed this to make powerguru have a
separete backend and GUI, rather than the way I was doing it with TraceGUI.

  Not much works but datalogging to a MySQL database someplace. I've got
broadband, so I write my data to my server at work. I've just started the PHP
pages to plot the data. These are in the web directory, but once again, barely
started.

  This originally started life as TraceGUI, but I got distracted rebuilding
my entire houses's power system, GTK1 and Glade1 went to 2.0 releases that were
incompatable enough with the previous versions to make upgrading slow. Then
Trace became Xantrex, and I bought an Outback MX-60...

  I got the idea to make a tiny backend so it would run on a 12VDC,
Linux based motherboard like a Nexus, a Via, or a Soekris. This would do
datalogging directly and support an SNMP connection to execute remote commands.
This way I could have multiple front ends, a command line interface, a
graphical one, and a web based one. Ideally I'd even like one that's written
in QT or Java so I can run it on my Zaurus 6000-L.
